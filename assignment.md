## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each question:

Question 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Scrum is based on the 12 agile manifesto principles.
First, scrum provides the customers with early and continuous software delivery which keeps the customers happy and build trust between the startup company and school.
Second, scrum is able to accommodate to changing requirements throughout the development process, which avoids delays when a requirement or feature request changes.
Third, scrum provides frequent collaboration between the business stakeholders (i.e., school) and developers throughout the project, which improves the decision-making process.
Fourth, scrum provides support, trust and motivates the people involved to deliver their best work.
Fifth, scrum encourages face-to-face interaction which improves communication among team members.
Sixth, scrum uses working functional software as the primary measure of progress as opposed to detailed documentations using the waterfall approach.
Seventh, scrum ensures that the team pay attention to technical details and design, constantly improve the product, and sustain change.
Eighth, scrum ensures simplicity and avoid over-engineering which reduces unnecessary manpower cost.
Ninth, scrum encourages self-organization where all team members have the decision-making power, take ownership, communicate regularly with other team members, and share ideas that deliver quality products.
Tenth, scrum provides regular reflections during sprint retrospective on how to become more effective through self-improvement, process improvement, advancing skills, and techniques which help team members to work more efficiently.
All the above principles help to improve productivity.
